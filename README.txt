DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/


RUNNING THE GAME:

Open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Keys:
  Spacebar - advance menus, or place your stacking boxes.

Description:
  Boxes will move back and forth at varying speeds. Press the spacebar to stop the boxes and move on to the next row. Only boxes that have something underneath them will be stacked. As the tower rises, the game will make your tower thinner. You win a minor prize at the 10th level (the blocks change color), and if you reach the 15th level, you will win the major prize. Good luck!

GAME BACKGROUND:

"Slacker" is a clone/parody of the popular arcade game "Stacker", in which you must stack blocks to the top of the screen in order to win the game. In the arcade version, credits are expensive (often $1 per play), but the prizes are excellent (the one that I played let you choose between an iPod, a PSP, a DS, or a camcorder). As you might guess, it is an extremely difficult game to win. I have made my own version of the game correspondingly hard, so that the next time I go back to the restaurant, I will have a better chance to win a good prize. Despite the hard nature of the game, I hope will enjoy it, and if you wind up practicing with the game and getting so good that you win an extra iPod, I wouldn't mind if you sent it my way. :)

Please forgive the small scope of the project - I started it on the last day of the competition, and didn't have much time to put into it. Still, I hope you enjoyed it!
