Slacker
=======

**Slacker** is a clone/parody of the popular arcade game *Stacker*, in which
you must stack blocks to the top of the screen in order to win the game. Boxes
will move back and forth at varying speeds. Press Space to stop the boxes and
move on to the next row. Only boxes that have something underneath them will be
stacked. As the tower rises, the game will make your tower thinner. You win a
minor prize at the 10th level (the blocks change color), and if you reach the
15th level, you will win the major prize. Good luck!

In the arcade version, credits are expensive (often $1 per play), but the
prizes are excellent (the one that I played let you choose between an iPod, a
PSP, a DS, or a camcorder). As you might guess, it is an extremely difficult
game to win. I have made my own version of the game correspondingly hard, so
that the next time I go back to the restaurant, I will have a better chance to
win a good prize. Despite the hard nature of the game, I hope will enjoy it,
and if you wind up practicing with the game and getting so good that you win an
extra iPod, I wouldn't mind if you sent it my way. :)

This game and the above description was originally written by Clint and
Jennifer Herron (see credits). I (McSinyx) fork the game to improve the
codebase, make it more similar to the arcade game and hopefully add more
features.
